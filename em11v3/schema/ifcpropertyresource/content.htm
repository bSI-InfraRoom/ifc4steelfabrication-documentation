<h3 class="std">8.8.1 Schema Definition</h3>

	 <P> The <I>IfcPropertyResource</I> defines a basic set of property types
		that can be associated with occurrence objects (subtypes of <a href="../ifckernel/lexical/ifcobject.htm">IfcObject</a>)
		and type objects (subtypes of <I>IfcTypeObject</I>) through the
		<a href="../ifckernel/lexical/ifcpropertyset.htm">IfcPropertySet</a> (defined in the Kernel). These properties are used to
		assign property definitions that are semantically defined by a name string and
		are extensible in terms of their definitions.</P> 
	 <BLOCKQUOTE> 
		<P><FONT SIZE="-1">NOTE: Frequently, there is a need to extend the
		  attributes that are attached to an individual object or group of objects. Yet
		  it may not be necessary to extend the attributes for every object within the
		  same class. Using the same capabilities as for types of an element, it is
		  possible to define such sets of attributes and associate them with individual
		  objects.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE> 
	 <P>The association of attributes to objects can be defined by two different
		ways:</P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI>by defining a type object (<I>IfcTypeObject</I>) which defines a
		  specific object information (including the relevant properties) which are
		  attached to all instances (or occurrences) of the type object (via the
		  <I>IfcRelDefinedByType</I> relationship).</LI> 
		<LI>by defining a property set (<a href="../ifckernel/lexical/ifcpropertyset.htm">IfcPropertySet</a>, a logical grouping
		  of related properties) which defines the common property information for a
		  group of instances (or occurrences), this is done via the
		  <I>IfcRelDefinedByProperties</I> relationship.</LI> 
	 </UL> 
	 <P>The semantic information of what an individual property denotes has to
		be given by the <I>Name</I> attribute. The <I>Name</I> is human interpretable
		and can also be computer interpretable by convention. This convention has to be
		established by implementers' agreements.</P> 
	 <BLOCKQUOTE> 
		<P><FONT SIZE="-1">NOTE: The IFC specification defines a set of property
		  sets, which provides a recommended usage of property sets for objects in the
		  IFC model. In addition to the IFC property set specification also regional or
		  project specific definitions of property sets are possible. Thereby property
		  sets provide an mechanism to localize IFC definitions.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE> 
	 <P>All subtypes of <a href="../ifcpropertyresource/lexical/ifcproperty.htm">IfcProperty</a> are referenced later by the
		<a href="../ifckernel/lexical/ifcpropertyset.htm">IfcPropertySet</a>. Thereby the <a href="../ifckernel/lexical/ifcpropertyset.htm">IfcPropertySet</a> establishes a tree of
		property definitions through the <a href="../ifcpropertyresource/lexical/ifcsimpleproperty.htm">IfcSimpleProperty</a> (and its subtypes)
		and <I>IfcComplexProperty</I>. It should be noted, that any instance of
		<a href="../ifcpropertyresource/lexical/ifcsimpleproperty.htm">IfcSimpleProperty</a> (and its subtypes) shall only be referenced once (by
		either <a href="../ifckernel/lexical/ifcpropertyset.htm">IfcPropertySet</a> or <I>IfcComplexProperty</I>).</P>
	 <BLOCKQUOTE>
		<P><FONT SIZE="-1">NOTE: The property set attached to an object shall
		  have a tree structure, therefore all properties (either
		  <a href="../ifcpropertyresource/lexical/ifcsimpleproperty.htm">IfcSimpleProperty</a> -and subtypes- or <I>IfcComplexProperty</I>) shall be
		  used only once within that structure.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE><p><a href="../../annex/annex-d/ifcpropertyresource/index.htm" ><img src="../../img/diagram.png" style="border: 0px" title="Link to EXPRESS-G diagram" alt="Link to EXPRESS-G diagram">&nbsp;EXPRESS-G diagram</a></p>
