	 <H2>IfcUtilityResource </H2> 
	 <P>The resource schema <I>IfcUtilityResource</I> deals with the general
		concepts of Ownership and Change. It also includes a basic information
		construct: Tables. The classes of this schema are referenced throughout the
		whole IFC Object Model by all of its Model Layers as defined in the IFC
		Architecture Document. The <I>IfcUtilityResource</I> schema consequently
		contains model specifications for specifying the information content of a
		number of utility types.</P> 
	 <P>This schema contains the following concepts:</P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI>Ownership</LI> 
		<LI>History</LI> 
		<LI>Table</LI> 
	 </UL> 
	 <P><B>Ownership</B></P> 
	 <P>Each object, relationship and type definition will provide information
		about their current ownership. Ownership information is the currently "owning"
		application and the owning (responsible) actor. This ownership information can
		be used for access and change permissions. Ownership can be transferred from
		one person to another through the life cycle of a project.</P> 
	 <P><B>History</B></P> 
	 <P>The history of an IFC object is captured simply in the form of last
		modifying user, application and date.</P> 
	 <P><B>Table</B></P> 
	 <P>The specification of table is general purpose and may be used for any
		two dimensional matrix type document. It allows information to be recorded in
		rows and columns where each column is labeled with the type of information it
		contains. The model does not allow for any mathematical operations on the
		information content of a table (i.e. it does not function as a
		spreadsheet).</P>

		<P><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE="-1">The various types of registries were
		  removed from this schema in IFC R2.0 since the method used within applications
		  to store those types of information could differ between different
		  applications.</FONT></P> 
		<P><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE="-1">This schema was significantly
		  simplified in IFC R2x to reduce overhead. Refer to the change log and issues
