<p>This document specifies a conceptual data schema and an exchange file format for Building Information Modeling BIM data. The conceptual schema is adoped from Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), specified in ISO 16739.</p>
<p>ISO 16739 represents an open international standard for BIM data that is exchanged and shared among software applications used by the various participants in a building construction or facility management project.</p>
<p>ISO 16739 consists of the data schema, represented as an EXPRESS schema specification, and reference data, represented as definitions of properties and quantities.</p>
<p>A subset of the data schema and referenced data is referred to as a model view definition. A particular model view definition is defined to support one or many recognized workflows in the structural steel industry sector. Each workflow identifies data exchange requirements for software applications.</p>
<p>This document represents model view definitions for structural steel industry. It defines workflows for the lifecycle of structural steel in AEC industry, from conceptual architectural design, steel structural model, mill order, structural analysis, steel detailing, manufacturing, and construction.</p>
