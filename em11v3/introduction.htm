        Introduction
      </h1>
      <p class="std">AISC has set a long term interoperability strategy centered on   developing IFC to support the exchange of information as it relates to   steel framed projects. </p>
<p class="std">Given the complexity and size of the task, AISC   has developed some ideas to move the development along more rapidly. </p>
<p class="std">One   of these ideas is to support efforts on data exchange and ensure these   efforts are coordinated with other efforts within the IFC for steel   arena, shared with other interested parties as soon as practical, and   not proprietary, or 'flavors' of IFC.</p>
